Problem Statement
 	In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. 
 	For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
 	 In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
Steps of analysis
1.	Reading and understanding data
2.	Cleaning data
3.	Defining target variable
4.	EDA and feature engineering
5.	Reducing dimensionality
6.	Outlier management
7.	Handling High Imbalance class in target variable
8.	Data modelling - Logistic regression and Random Forest
9.	Feature importance
Inferences from the Final Model
	Churn rate is low in customers with longer tenure or age on network
	Churn rate is low as frequency of recharge in active month increases
	Churn rate is low as frequency of total recharge in good month increases
	Customers who tend to churn recharges with amt less than 200 on last recharge
Business advises
	Company should focus on low tenure high value customers because they are highly prone to churn
	Concentrate on Customers who tend to churn recharges with amt less than 200 on last recharge
	Company should keep an eye on the drop of spl_og_mou, and spl_ic_mou, 'monthly_2g, monthly_3g, rech_before_lastday in active month
	There is an overall reduction of activity in active month for the customers who are likely to churn
